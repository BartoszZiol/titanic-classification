# Titanic – Machine learning from the disaster

## Project description

The project aims to build a residual classification model of whether a given Titanic passenger crashed. The data comes from the **[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)** competition - one of the most recognizable and classic sets in the world of data science.

As part of the rest project:
1. **Data mining (EDA)** – content overview, variable distribution, visualizations.
2. **Data cleaning** – filling in the gaps, converting the corresponding ones, removing unnecessary features.
3. **Feature engineering** – creating new variables (e.g. `Title`, `FamilySize`.
4. **Training and evaluation of models** – including: Logistic regression, random forest.
5. **Prediction** – generating final results on the test set.

The project demonstrates the entire workflow (pipeline) in a machine knowledge data science task.
